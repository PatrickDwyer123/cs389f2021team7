1. I figured out what my plan is to complete the tasks I have to do.

2. Today I will try to complete tasks 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1.

3. Some obstacles that are impeding my progress are where to start and where to put certian things in the code. 

4. This is our First Scrum.

5. I will continue to work on my tasks.

6. So far there isn't anything impeding my progress.

1. I managed to retrieve data from the World Bank API, added location permissions request, and got the country code from the location to retrieve the appropriate data from the World Bank API.

2. I will try to make some progress with the layout.

3. Nothing in particular.

4. This is our First Scrum.

5. Continue to work on the World Bank API and sync the values with the footprint image. Also, try to make some progress with the layout.

6. Nothing in particular.

3.	Taking time away from other work/classes to begin. 

4.	This is our first Scrum.
