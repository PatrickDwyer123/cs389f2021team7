1. I figured out what my plan is to complete the tasks I have to do.

2. Today I will try to complete tasks 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1.

3. Some obstacles that are impeding my progress are where to start and where to put certian things in the code. 

4. This is our First Scrum.

5. I will continue to work on my tasks.

6. So far there isn't anything impeding my progress.
