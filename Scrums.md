## Scrum Template
There are 3 questions in the daily Scrum meeting:
1.	What did I accomplish yesterday?
2.	What will I do today?
3.	What obstacles are impeding my progress?

For the project we will have the 3 following questions:
1.	What did I accomplish since the last Scrum?
2.	What will I do until the next Scrum?
3.	What obstacles are impeding my progress?
